## Introduction 

This is a simple template for writing an essay in markdown, that can be visualised in HTML and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Body

In this template, you can format your text with markdown commands. Pretty much [all formatting rules that can be used in GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) should work out of the box here too. 

### Simple formatting

This means, for example, that you can put text in _italics_, and in **bold**, and even ~~strike out~~ text if necessary. And you can also directly use `.html` tags in the text, like for <sup>supralinear text</sup>. You can also use the odd footnote[^1] if you please. 

You can also use unordered lists:

- item
- item
- item

Or ordered lists:

1. item
2. item
3. item

Just don't forget to add an empty line before starting your list! 

### More specialist formatting

You can even use checkboxes, although it may be tricky to find a good use case for this:

- [ ] item
- [x] item

And you can include some inline `code`, or add a code block:
```
This is
a code
block
```

### Images

You can also include an image, with a caption, like this one:

### Quoting sources

To quote sources, you can automatically generate in-text and full references you have added to your `references.bib` file. Such as, for example, for "this fake quote" [@doe2020, 22]. Supposedly, you can also add several references in the same parenthesis [@doe2020; @smith2021]. And you can also use bock quotes:

> This is a very long but relevant statement. 
>
> [@doe2020, 25]

## Conclusion
Neat, right?
