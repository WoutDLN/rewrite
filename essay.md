## Introduction 

This is a simple template for writing an essay in markdown, that can be visualised in HTML and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Body

In this template, you can format your text with markdown commands. Pretty much [all formatting rules that can be used in GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) should work out of the box here too. 

### Simple formatting

This means, for example, that you can put text in _italics_, and in **bold**, and even ~~strike out~~ text if necessary. And you can also directly use `.html` tags in the text, like for <sup>supralinear text</sup>. You can also use the odd footnote[^1] if you please. 

You can also use unordered lists:

- ice
- lemon
- 2 oz gin
- tonic

Or ordered lists:

1. Add ice to a glass.
2. Pour the gin over the ice.
3. Top up with tonic.
4. Cut a slice of lemon peel off the lemon.
5. Direct the lemon peel's outer layer towards the drink, and squeeze to spray its oils into the glass.
6. Add the lemon peel to the drink.
7. Enjoy, responsibly!

Just don't forget to add an empty line before starting your list! 

### More specialist formatting

You can even use checkboxes, although it may be tricky to find a good use case for this:

- [x] check references
- [ ] take a nap

And you can include some inline `code`, or add a code block:
```
This is
a code
block
```

### Images and tables

You can also include an image, with a caption, like this one:

![**Figure 1.** A graph to help people decide whether or not they should try to disturb me in my office depending on the urgency of their query. cc-by 4.0 Wout Dillen 2026](assets/img/knock-graph.jpg)

Or you can add a table like so:

: **Table 1.** Albums Wout likes to listen to while coding.

|Artist|Album|Year|
|------|-----|----|
|Mel Brown|Chicken Fat|1969|
|Ballaké Sissoko and Baba Sissoko|Sissoko & Sissoko|2019|
|Shabaka and the Ancestors|We Are Sent Here By History|2020|
|Alice Coltrane|The Carnegie Hall Concert (Live)|2024|
|Kahlil El'Zabar|Spirit Groove: Golden Sea Duo in Shenzhen|2025|
|Knats|Knats|2025|

### Quoting sources

To quote sources, you can automatically generate in-text and full references you have added to your `references.bib` file. Such as, for example, for "this fake quote" [@doe2020, 22]. Supposedly, you can also add several references in the same parenthesis [@doe2020; @smith2021]. And you can also use bock quotes:

> This is a very long but relevant statement. 
>
> [@doe2020, 25]
